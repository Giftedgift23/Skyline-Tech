A table is a representation of data arranged in rows and columns. it's more like a spreadsheet. In HTML, with tables, you can arrange data like images, texts, links and so on into rows and columns of cells. CSS is used to apply the various styling properties to the HTML Table elements. Each table may have an associated caption that provides a short description of the table's purpose. 

 A table is defined using the <table> element, and contains a number of table cells (<th>, table head and <td> table data) which are organised into table rows <tr>. We also have <tbody> for the body of the table and <thead> element for the head

 in CSS, we use border collapse property, and the other properties to style our HTML Table
